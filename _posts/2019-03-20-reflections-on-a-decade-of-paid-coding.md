I have spent better part of my professional career in some startup or other as one of
the earliest engineers. This has meant , I was thrust into the frying pan far too often
and had to figure my way out. In architecture everyone has an opinion. 

> To docker or not to docker <br/>
> React vs angular vs jquery <br/>
> ruby vs python <br/>
> To app or not to app <br/>
> Microservice vs monolith <br/>

All the above the age old Shakespearean dilemma of "whats in a name?" can take a lot of time
not spent coding. While I have no answer of what is the best name for a repo or a variable or function,
I have found my individual answers to a few architectural questions.
